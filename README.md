# X for Y generation.

## Description
This is a simple program which generates psuedo random startup ideas, based on a "The X for Y" format.  Our Twitter Bot can be found here: https://twitter.com/NextBigThingBot.

## Helping
If you would like to help you can : 
- Add X's to X.txt.
- Add Y's to Y.txt.

These are pretty easy.  Just put your ideas on a new line in the file, commit, push, and send us the pull request. The only rule is 1 item per line. Obscene things may or may not be merged.

Some items are mentions more than once, like Uber.  This increases the likelyhood that it is choosen.
