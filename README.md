# XforYgen
A very simple script that generates X for Y to help you come up with a startup idea.

Add X to X.txt.

Add Y to Y.txt.

1 Item per line.

Run with $python3 gen.py

Some items in in X more than once.  This is because they are bigger buzz words.  Having an item in either list multiple times is fine, that will just make it get picked more often.
